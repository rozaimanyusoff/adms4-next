# Purchase Records Edit Mode Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### ✅ Fixed: Requester Field Disabled in Edit Mode
- **Location**: Line ~1005 in purchase-records.tsx
- **Change**: Added `disabled={employeesLoading || sidebarMode === 'edit'}` to Requester Combobox
- **Reason**: Requester should not be changeable in edit mode, consistent with Request Date and Request Number

### ✅ Fixed: Missing Requester Validation
- **Location**: Line ~496 in purchase-records.tsx  
- **Change**: Added `if (!formData.pic) errors.pic = 'Requester is required';`
- **Reason**: Form validation was missing for the required Requester field

### ✅ Enhanced: Visual Feedback for Read-only Fields
- **Location**: Lines ~960-990 in purchase-records.tsx
- **Changes**:
  - Added `className={sidebarMode === 'edit' ? 'bg-muted text-muted-foreground' : ''}` to Request Date and Request Number inputs
  - Added `className={sidebarMode === 'edit' ? 'opacity-60' : ''}` to Requester Combobox  
  - Added helper text "This field cannot be changed in edit mode" for all three fields
- **Reason**: Better UX - users can clearly see which fields are locked in edit mode

## Fields Now Properly Locked in Edit Mode

1. **Request Date** - Cannot be modified (with visual styling)
2. **Request Number** - Cannot be modified (with visual styling)  
3. **Requester** - Cannot be modified (with visual styling)

## Verification Steps

1. Open the purchase records page
2. Click "Edit" on any existing purchase record
3. Verify that Request Date, Request Number, and Requester fields are:
   - Visually distinct (grayed out/disabled appearance)
   - Non-editable (disabled/readonly)
   - Show helper text indicating they cannot be changed
4. Verify other fields are still editable
5. Test form submission to ensure changes save correctly

## API Payload Structure (Unchanged)

The API payload mapping remains correct:
- `costcenter` → `costcenter_id`
- `pic` → `ramco_id` 
- `items` → `description`

## Notes

- Changes maintain backward compatibility
- Form validation now includes requester field
- Visual feedback helps prevent user confusion
- Edit mode functionality preserved for all other fields
